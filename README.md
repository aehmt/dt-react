# Webpack-React-Heroku Boilerplate

Heroku deployable boilerplate for React/Flux/Webpack apps.
This sample is a reference to this [post](http://ditrospecta.com/javascript/react/es6/webpack/heroku/2015/08/08/deploying-react-webpack-heroku.html).


To run a session with hot reloads:
`$ npm run devbuild`
`$ npm start`
This should include all the webpack middleware.
